# FloraDex

FloraDex is a digital press book designed for casual naturists to identify and document floral discoveries.

## The Concept

The project aims to provide a gamified experience for building a personal herbarium. By focusing on digital collection, users can engage with their environment and "collect" flowers in a fun, interactive way without the need to pick or damage live plants.

## Project Status: Coming Soon

This application is currently in early development. The initial release will focus on the core collection mechanics and the collecting interface.
